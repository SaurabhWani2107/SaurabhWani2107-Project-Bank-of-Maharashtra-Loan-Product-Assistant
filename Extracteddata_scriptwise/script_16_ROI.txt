Interest Concession under Model Education loan scheme –
1% interest concession be provided to the loanees, if the interest is serviced regularly as and when applied during the study period when repayment holiday specified for interest / repayment under the scheme. In other word, the option of servicing the interest is with the borrower. The concession is available for the moratorium period only. However, minimum applicable ROI shouldn’t be below RLLR as floor rate. As a uniform procedure, branches should offer the option to the borrowers either to service the interest during the moratorium period as and when applied and avail 1 % concession or opt for the repayment of interest together with principal after completion of the course/moratorium. Needless to say that in later option, no interest concessions is to be provided.
Please Note: Under both the conditions, the repayment start date in CBS (both interest and principal) should start after completion of Moratorium period only.
In respect of borrowers availing 1 % interest rate concession, branch should apply Interest at specified rate (without any concession) as per sanction letter. Branch should ensure that the interest is serviced as and when applied. Servicing of interest means repayment of interest amount debited to the loan account within 30 days. In eligible cases, at the time of regeneration of repayment schedule one month before repayment start date, manually interest @1% per annum will be reversed & credited to SB Account of the Borrower. For the purpose BGL – 76500 - Interest Received on Term Loan is to be adjusted through interest adjustment. In case borrower defaults in repayment of interest on due date for any particular month, interest concession is not to be provided for that month and on servicing of interest for any subsequent month together with interest for defaulted month(s), concession is to be provided for the month in respect of which interest has been serviced.
